# Word Prediction (n-grams)
Language Engineering Project: 

## TODO:
- (done) replace w/ nltk
- (done) try other policy than maximum likelihood
	- predict next word
		- **if word does not exist in trigrams, use bigrams for known word**
- compare BIGRAM / TRIGRAM / (QUADGRAM)
	- (implement fourgrams)
- (done) implement learning from new data/test data
- (suggestions: get top 3 probabilities and randomly choose one)
