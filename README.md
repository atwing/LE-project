Language Engineering Project: 

## TODO:
- #replace w/ nltk
- try other policy than maximum likelihood
	- predict next word
		- **if word does not exist in trigrams, use bigrams for known word**
- compare BIGRAM / TRIGRAM / (FOURGRAM)
	- (implement fourgrams)
- (implement learning from new data/test data)
